## Requirements

🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.
🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

## Reflection

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

# Additional Reflection

Building the server:

I feel this was the first week the process for full-stack has fully clicked. I found it surprisingly straight forward to follow the workshops during my assignment and set up the server route. I was able to test the POST method quite early in the process (<a href="./client/public/images/Postman_Test.jpg>">Test image here</a>). I had to fight my imposter syndrome though as I couldn't quite believe it it would work first time. This assignment has shown me that I can trust myself better and while not everything makes comlete sense, I'm able to understand the smaller building stones and I'm able to build small applications now, which is a massive development from what I was able to do 4 weeks ago (mainly didn't even know what fullstack or git was).

Building the client:

realised there is some issue with how it displays the dates, I had some help through supabase and how to add it to JS, there were some issues, so I used AI to debug as I couldn't find the error
